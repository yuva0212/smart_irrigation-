**Introduction**
The Smart Irrigation System uses an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Based on the sensor readings, the system decides whether to activate a water pump for irrigation. The sensor data is sent to a server, where it can be monitored and analyzed.

**Features**
Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
Automated irrigation based on sensor data
Data logging and analysis
Predictive water requirement calculations

**Hardware Requirements**
ESP32 microcontroller
DHT11 sensor (for temperature and humidity)
Soil moisture sensor
5V water pump
Relay module
Connecting wires
Breadboard or PCB

**Software Requirements**
Arduino IDE
Node.js and npm
